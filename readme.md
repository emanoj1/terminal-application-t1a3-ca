**About**:  
The Travel Checklist is an app to keep track of all the things a traveller needs to carry with them for their travel.  

**App features**:  
<ol>
<li>Create entries of things to carry</li>
<li>View full list</li>
<li>Check completed list</li>
<li>Check pending list</li>
</ol>

**How will the app function**  
When the Python code is executed, the system will welcome the user, and provide the user with a numbered menu to choose from. If the user wishes to make a new entry, they will choose the option to make a new checklist and the system will proceed to ask him/her firstly their name, their travel destination, and the date of travel. Once these are stored, it will proceed to ask them to enter each items in a numbered manner. This will continue till the user quits, upon which it will thank them for the entries, and list the initial menus again. If the user wishes to ever track their completed or pending items of a list, they can do so by choosing the specific menu option.
